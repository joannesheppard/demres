## DEMRES
This is a collection of dementia-related research projects I am currently working on, in my role as visiting researcher at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School:
* DEMINS - a case control study looking at the association between dementia and insomnia. The protocol for this study can be viewed on the [UoS research site](http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/70021/). Quick links for peer-reviewers: [Read code lists](https://github.com/zurfarosa/demres/blob/master/common/codelists.py); [drug lists](https://github.com/zurfarosa/demres/blob/master/common/druglists.py); and [prescribed daily doses](https://github.com/zurfarosa/demres/blob/master/output/drug_pdds.csv).
* DEMPRED - a dementia predictor, using routinely collected primary care variables, such as medication history, mental health diagnoses and primary care visit frequency. *This is still very much a work in progress*
