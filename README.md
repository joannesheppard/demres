# DEMRES
This is a collection of dementia-related research projects I am currently working on, in my role as visiting researcher at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School:
* DEMINS - a case control study looking at the association between dementia and insomnia
* DEMPRED - a dementia predictor, using routinely collected primary care variables, such as medication history, mental health diagnoses and primary care visit frequency. *This is still very much a work in progress*

The demres/data directory will *not* be cloned, as they contain anonymised but still confidential patient data. If you are a team member and wish to have access to these files, please contact me at richard.hoile@sussexpartnership.nhs.uk
